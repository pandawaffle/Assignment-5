    I'm almost done...
    
    I visited the TA office hours and they helped set me straight on my approach the base 27 concept, as well as numerous syntax errors, a rough draft of a compile script and file passing.
    I would say I am 90% done as of now. I need to test compiling as well as scan for errors, but I have writen every single function. I will actually have to work backwards to make milestone 1 work.

    Added in all of the files I have been working on
    
    It's a mess. I need to consildate the work I have been doing into lang.cpp, lang.h and one scrap file.
